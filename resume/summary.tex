%---------------------------------------------------------
I am a highly driven goal-oriented software engineer with a variety of technical
experience aquired through self-teaching, industry experience, and formal education.
After over five years experience in dynamic large-scale system architecture and
administration from my time at Facebook and ViaSat Inc., I began pursuing my
passion for entrepreneurship and full stack software development. After four
years of technical and leadership work at JMKRIDE and GoSchoolBox, I am in a
position where I have offloaded my responsibilities at JMKRIDE and am looking to
continue my career with an exciting remote/hybrid role in full stack software
development.
