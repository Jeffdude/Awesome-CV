I am a highly driven goal-oriented software engineer with a variety of technical
experience aquired through self-teaching, industry experience, and formal
education.  After over five years experience in large-scale system
architecture and administration from my time at Facebook and ViaSat, I dove
headfirst into the world of Javascript and React. I obtained a strong full-stack
knowledge base by implementing and deploying four public sites for my
company JMKRIDE. Since then, I've handled scaling bottlenecks at a fast-moving
startup, and I've tackled tech debt re-architectures of several legacy and
backward-compatible codebases. Now, I am seeking new challenges in the form of
full-stack software consulting.
