\begin{cvletter}

\lettersection{Why Trellisware Technologies?}
My main reason for choosing Trellisware Technologies is the referral of a good
friend and college colleage of mine, Ace Bansal. His recommendation, my
alignment to the company mission and culture, my perfect fit of technological
experience, and my personal interest in designing and implementing intuitive web
UIs all make Trellisware Technologies seem like a great fit for me.

\lettersection{Why Me?}
I was shocked while reading through the required "knowledge, skills, and
abilities" section, I felt as though they were written specifically for my
background! I have extensive experience programming in Javascript, React, and
Express. I have always excelled at written and verbal skills (enough so to
notice that those skills are mentioned twice on that list).  And one of my past
projects, the "Freeskater Finder", which I designed, implemented and deployed
myself, is essentially a wrapper around the Google Maps Javascript API, and so I
have become intimately familiar with it and its attribute-based structure of
location information. Let me explain how I believe I am a perfect fit for this
position. 

During my entrepreneurial industry experiences, from JMKRIDE and GoSchoolBox,
I created several website user interfaces from scratch. I learned to model the
basic UI structure off of other popular user interfaces, to keep view nesting to
a minimum, and to get user feedback early and often during development. I
believe my UI/UX experiences will be very useful in this position on
Trellisware's Applications team.

My past experience at Facebook has also given me incredibly valuable experiences
interacting with and visualizing large datasets. After completing the MVP of
JMKRIDE's internal stock tracking application, the JMKRIDE's CEO asked me if it
were possible to view the trends over time of inventory as they are
added/subtracted to the site. I was able to create a MongoDB aggregation that
binned the many inventory updates across a fully configurable time range to
provide a performant and intuitive visualization that was reminiscent of several
tools I personally used while at Facebook.

Lastly, I have gained and demonstrated a number of leadership and interpersonal
skills both technical and personal through arguably the most challenging of
leadership environments: small companies/startups. I've learned countless
valuable lessons from my experience managing half of the entire engineering
workforce of GoSchoolBox while we underwent dramatic platform and
customer-changes in the typical startup manor. 

Thank you for your time and consideration.
