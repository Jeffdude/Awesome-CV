\begin{cvletter}

\lettersection{Why ReFED?}
I am completely aligned with ReFED's mission, and I would be proud to help make
progress towards the goal of reducing food waste. But frankly, the biggest
reason for my interest in working for ReFED is the recommendation from my
colleage, Skyler Sinclair. Throughout our time together at Harvey Mudd College I
always regarded them as being very intelligent both academically and
practically, so their recommendation is a strong positive signal for me about
the mission and working environment at your company. I would be excited to get
to work with them, to get to know the rest of the team, and to contribute to
your mission.

\lettersection{Why Me?}
My varied past work experiences means that I approach all new problems with a
strong foundation of full stack understanding, and because I've experienced
several ends of the tech-stack spectrum, I have a unique understanding of
how much complexity and optimization is necessary to solve a problem efficiently. 

As an example, Working on the cache service deployment for the (at-the-time)
world's largest MySQL deployment at Facebook taught me just how optimized and
streamlined some services need to be. I also implemented and deployed up a
bespoke inventory management website for just three employees at
JMKRIDE, which taught me to seek feedback early and to spend the extra time
understanding the requirements and designing before starting the code. And of
course, I've thrived in several past-positions with technical requirements that
fall between those two extremes.

Lastly, because of the consistently relaxed development pace of my current
employer, Trellisware, which I have worked at for almost two years, I have
plenty of availability and flexibility during my week. In the past two years, I
have proven this availability by tackling various website deployment issues for
JMKRIDE, or by acheiving an embarrasing level of progression in my favorite
factory building video game, Satisfactory. I am very goal-oriented
person, and I can assure you that when I have agreed to a delivery date, those
deliverables will always be delivered on time and without sacrificing quality.

\lettersection{My Proposal}
As this is my first foray into technical consulting, I would be happy to accept
the \$125 hourly rate as mentioned in the job posting. My current
responsibilities means that I am able to work a maximum of 20 hours per week.
All my commitments are fully remote individually driven engineering development,
so my specific time availability is almost entirely flexible. The exception being
weekly scrums on Tuesdays 11:00am - 12:00pm PST, and an on-site day which is
Wednesday mornings, when I am unavailable before 2:00pm.
